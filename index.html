				<p>Welcome to my application for FAC Spring 2020! I am applying because I have been teaching myself to code using MOOCs and books for a year on and off, and I would like to take the next step to becoming a professional software designer. I regularly attend Codebar and that's where I met
				some members of the Spring 2019 cohort, who were inspiring in their coolness and enthusiasm. I decided to apply that evening and filled in an expression of interest on the tube home.</p>
				<p>I initially got into coding because I had a place on the Product Design bachelor's at CSM, but couldn't take the place as I already had a degree. I knew I wanted to work making a wide array of different things and gain technical knowledge as well, but I was quite defeated until I started wondering if I would be up to learning how to code. It was really Karlie Kloss that pushed me to try- I thought if she could do it, I could too. I read about Harvard CS50 online and jumped straight in with C.</p>
				<p>I've used the prerequisite to build a webpage as an opportunity to make a small portfolio website for visionova.studio, the 'design studio' which really consists of me, my dining room table & a bookshelf of art supplies. Although I plan on becoming a full time web developer, I love to design and hope to keep dreaming, and drawing, for a long time on the side.</p>

		<!--FIXED: the long delay... I just had two of the same jpgs in a row...-->
		<!--FIXED: the JS had to be below the creation of the button in HTML -->
		<!--FIXED: the pause button only worked the first time because I wasn't creating a new intervalID with the subsequent calls-->
		
		<!--Seems like there's no good way to animate a transition with a changing image source... 
		What if I make this janky transition into a stop motion animation?-->
